Within the repository "Field-Phenotyper" there is information pertaining to the project about a root phenotyper in the field. 
Any questions? Please discuss with Naomi

Goals of this project include:
being able to quickly phenotype (number of brace roots, number of nodes, distance between nodes, diameter/volume of root, etc) brace roots of corn in the field by taking many pictures that meet criteria for scripts (from Bucksch lab) to collect phenotypic quantitative information effectively. 

Collaborators on project are from Alex Bucksch's Lab (https://www.warnell.uga.edu/people/faculty/dr-alexander-bucksch ; look at DIRT). 
So far most of Naomi's contact has been with post doc Suxing, including access to full scale phenotyper.
